# Congrats you've completed this guide! 

In this tutorial, you created, read, updated, and deleted an order resource in HashiCorp's demo application. In the process, you've learned how Terraform interacts with target APIs via providers.

A full list of official, partner and community Terraform providers can be found on the [Terraform Provider Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers). We encourage you to find a provider you're interested in and experiment!

To learn how to recreate the HashiCups provider, visit our [Learn Providers Collection](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/providers).

To learn more about provider source, refer to [Automatic Installation of Third-Party Providers with Terraform 0.13 blog post](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/automatic-installation-of-third-party-providers-with-terraform-0-13).
