Thanks for attending the the Terraform **Infrastructure Pipelines Workshop**.

Congratulations â€” you have successfully completed the scenario and deployed a
pipeline of Terraform Cloud workspaces to implement a Kubernetes cluster with
Consul and Vault deployed within it. By keeping your infrastructure
configuration modular and creating a pipeline of workspaces using run triggers,
your Terraform configuration becomes extensible and easier to understand.

There's no need to destroy or clean up the environments you created in this lab,
they will be deleted automatically.

Return to the main Zoom meeting for the group Q&A session.
