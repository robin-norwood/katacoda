The Terraform configuration for each resource (Kubernetes, Consul, and Vault)
are modularized and committed to their respective version control system
repositories. Before the workshop, you received an email giving you access to
the Terraform Cloud workspaces for each resource. These workspaces are
pre-configured with some of the variables you will need to complete the
workshop.

You will complete the first few steps in Terraform Cloud and the GitHub UI. Once
those are complete, you will use the Katacoda environment provided here to
complete the final steps.
