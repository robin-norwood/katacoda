# Organize Terraform Configuration

In this workshop, you'll organize Terraform configuration using an example
configuration that manages static websites hosted in AWS S3.

This workshop consists of five steps.

1. Start with a monolithic Terraform configuration
1. Split your configuration into multiple files
1. Separate state with Terraform Workspaces
1. Separate your infrastructure into separate project directories
1. Refactor and simplify your configuration using a module
